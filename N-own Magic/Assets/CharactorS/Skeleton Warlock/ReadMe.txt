Hi, and thank you for purchasing the Skeleton Warlock character. Please look out for more characters and asset packs from me, I plan on releasing a lot more soon. Backgrounds and UI packs will be released to match the fantasy genre as well.

PSDs are not included in these files.

All parts are swappable, as long as they are saved onto the same canvas size as the part you're trying to swap. 

* TUTORIAL *
To swap parts bring the prefab out onto the scene and locate the part that you're looking for, under the "Parts" section. 
Once you have the part selected, go to the top right of your inspector and change the mode from "Normal" to "Debug"
Expand "Saved Properties" and then expand "_MainTex" 
Expand "Second" and under the section that says "Texture" you can see the name of the part you're trying to change. Click on the circle icon and change this to whatever texture you'd like to swap the part to. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
*END OF TUTORIAL *

As for the Unity Package, I hope that it is straightforward. Thispack does include an optional helmet, which can be found under Parts > Head. I have left it on for now, but feel free to turn it off.

As you can see, some of the animations include a change of expression with in them, but feel free to change these to whatever you'd like. The more popular a character is, the more likely I am to release additional skins in future updates.

Please feel free to reach out and let me know if you like this character, or what other type of assets would be most helpful to you in the future.

If you have any questions or requests for future packs, please email me at Artbykandles@gmail.com 

Thank you again! Please enjoy! :)
